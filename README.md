# Eat-Da-Burger
<h2>Description</h2>
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

When the user clicks the button on an un-eaten burger, the burger will move to the right side of the page and can then be deleted.

This application will store every burger in a database, wheather devoured or not.
